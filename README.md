# Mapping_Earthquakes
Visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days

## Overview of the Project
In order to visually present the differences between the magnitude of earthquakes in the world, we use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then, also utilize the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Results
+ How is the district summary affected?
  
  Comparing the two screen shots from district summary before and after replacing the Thomas High School 9th grade students' scorres with NaN, we can observe about 0.1%-0.3% drop in "% Passing Math," "% Passing Reading," and "% Overall Passing" after the event.

  **After the replacement**

  Therefore, the replacement of scores to NaN did slightly negatively impact on the District Summary overall Passing percentage.
  
+ How is the school summary affected?
  
  Reviewing the below tables, we can find that "% Passing Math," "% Passing Reading," and "% Overall Passing" for Thomas High School are declined by approximately 0.3% after replacing the 9th Grade students' scores by NaN.

+ How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  

  
  Althouth the event affected the metrics in the previous two cases, the impact was not large enough to affect the ranking of Thomas High School relative to other schools as shown in the below two rankings.

## Summary
   Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

   In conclusion, the impact of replacing the reading and math scores with NaNs for the ninth grade at Thomas High School on the  school district analysis was minimul. Comparing each analysis result from before and the after change, we could find **0.1-0.3% decline** on "% Passing Math," "% Passing Reading," and "% Overall Passing" from the District Summary. Also, the "% Passing Math," "% Passing Reading," and "% Overall Passing" for Thomas High School are declined by approximately 0.3% after replacing the 9th Grade students' scores by NaN.
   
   However, all other measurements such as the ranking of Top and Bottom performing schools, Math and reading scores by grade, Scores by school spending, Scores by school size, and Scores by school type all did not show big differences. Therefore, the school board can make decesion on school budget without considering the impact from this event.
